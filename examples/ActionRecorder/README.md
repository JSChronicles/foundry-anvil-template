## Introduction

`ActionRecorder` provides a structured way for Anvil tasks to record actions, decisions, and outcomes during execution.

Instead of relying only on logging output, tasks can use `ActionRecorder` to produce consistent, machine-readable results that integrate with Anvil's execution summaries and reporting.

Using `ActionRecorder` is optional but strongly recommended for tasks that:

- modify infrastructure
- perform governance checks
- need auditable execution details

## Usage

`ActionRecorder` is available to tasks during execution and records concise,
audit-level task actions. Use logging for detailed task progress and
per-resource cleanup details.

You may record actions directly inside the required `run()` function. For larger
tasks, helper functions should usually log detailed per-resource work and return
control to `run()`, where the task records one high-level planned or completed
action.

---

### Example - Record Actions Directly in `run()`
This approach works well for small or single-purpose tasks.

```python
from anvil.actions import ActionRecorder

def run(
    *,
    account_id: str,
    account_alias: str,
    session,
    dry_run: bool,
    metadata: dict[str, object],
    actions: ActionRecorder,
) -> None:

    if dry_run:
        actions.record("(dry-run) Would validate account configuration")
    else:
        actions.record("Validated account configuration")
```

### Example - Log Details in Helper Functions
Passing work into helper functions is recommended for larger tasks that split
logic across multiple functions. Log detailed per-resource work in helpers and
record a concise action from `run()`.

```python
import logging

from anvil.actions import ActionRecorder

__LOGGER__ = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def cleanup_user(iam, user_name, dry_run):
    if dry_run:
        __LOGGER__.debug(f"(dry-run) Would delete IAM user: {user_name}")
    else:
        iam.delete_user(UserName=user_name)
        __LOGGER__.debug(f"Deleted IAM user: {user_name}")

def run(
    *,
    account_id: str,
    account_alias: str,
    session,
    dry_run: bool,
    metadata: dict[str, object],
    actions: ActionRecorder,
) -> None:
    iam = session.client("iam")
    cleanup_user(iam, metadata["user_name"], dry_run)

    if dry_run:
        actions.record(
            f"(dry-run) Would clean IAM resources for {metadata['user_name']}"
        )
    else:
        actions.record(f"Cleaned IAM resources for {metadata['user_name']}")
```
